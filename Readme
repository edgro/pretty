package pretty

     go get github.com/edgro/pretty
     The 151th fork of "github.com/kr/pretty".
     In this fork custom comparators for deep diff check of any go types added
     For example to use Diff with tolerance for all numeric fields:

	var (
		a, b interface{}
		e    float64
	)

	diffs, equals := pretty.NewCustomDiff(pretty.WithNumericEpsilon(e)).Diff(a, b)
